multiplication table 

n= int (input("Enter the number "))

for i in range (1,11):
  print (f"{n} x {i} = {n*i}")

  lessons :
  I learned about indentation where the print line is not supposed to place at the same vertical line as the above code for if while def etc  
  {} → Used to display variables or results dynamically inside strings.
  : → Used to start a block of code, like after for, if, while, def, etc.
  The f-string (f"...") allows you to insert variables directly inside the string
